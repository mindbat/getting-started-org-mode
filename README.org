/Short Tutorial on how to use org-mode for notes, todos, and reminders/

* Welcome to Org-Mode! [[file:org-mode-unicorn.png]]

Org-Mode can be a deep dive, even for experienced emacs users. This
tutorial will give you a quick tour of just a few of its features:
taking notes, tracking todos, and using the agenda to organize your
days and weeks.

There's lots to explore, so let's get started!

** Taking Notes

*** Init the el

Before we do anything else, let's make sure =auto-fill-mode= comes on
automatically when we're editing org files. It's basically the same as
turning on "Soft wrap" when creating a new [[gist.github.com][gist]].

Add this to your =init.el= file (usually in a directory like
=~/.emacs.d=:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'turn-on-auto-fill)
#+end_src

Then quit and restart emacs.

*** The Basics

The easiest way to get started using org-mode is for taking notes.

Open a new org buffer: =emacs tutorial.org=

This is going to be a daily journal. A record of things done, things
to do, and things we can yet only dream of.

Let's give the doc a header. A title, a declaration of purpose. Make
it the month and the year, so we know what we're looking at when we
come back:

#+begin_example
  * May 2021
#+end_example

Well done! It's not much, but it's the start of great things.

Let's make some sub-headings under there, for the days of the month:

#+begin_example
  * May 2021
  ** 3 May
  ** 4 May
  ** 5 May
  ** 6 May
  ** 7 May
#+end_example

More interesting, by far. And now we've unlocked the first of
org-mode's many powers: nesting.

Scroll back up to the first line, and hit =<tab>=.

Whoa! Where'd the other headings go?

Hit =<tab>= again. The top-level heading unfolds, revealing the
subheadings again.

org-mode carries this principle -- where sub-items are nested inside
higher-level ones, and can be revealed and hidden at will -- all the
way down, through headings, notes, etc.

Speaking of notes, let's add some:

#+begin_example
  * May 2021
  ** 3 May
  *** grocery-store run
  - need to pick up:
    + eggs
    + oat milk
    + cinnamon
    + loaf of bread (thick slices)
    + sugar
  - don't forget your mask!
  *** weekly council of ricks meeting
  - rick037 is loose again
  - rick048 thinks we should just let him go
    + i disagree
    + also rick048 has a mullet so we should ignore him
  - jerry077 got swapped with jerry099 at the last iteration of jerry's day-care romp,
    neither rick is admitting responsibility
  ** 4 May
  ** 5 May
  ** 6 May
  ** 7 May
#+end_example

Ok! Now we've got a list of groceries to pick up, and some meeting
notes. Play around with the nesting of the various elements, both by
hitting =<tab>= at various points to see what's revealed/hidden, and
changing the indention levels of the text. Notice which things
org-mode cares about, and which it ignores?

Congratulations! You've already mastered the art of taking notes in
org-mode. Well done!

*** Links

You've already seen a few links in this tutorial. Adding a new one is
easy (and very much like adding one in Markdown).

Let's add a new note entry linking to this repo:

#+begin_example
  - Notes about the org-mode tutorial:
      + repo [[https://github.com/mindbat/getting-started-with-org-mode][here]]
      + the text of the tutorial /is/ a tutorial! mindblown.gif
#+end_example

Nice! Note how org-mode swaps out displaying the link /and/ the text for
just the (now-underlined) _text_.

But there's a typo in our link. How do we fix it?

With your cursor over the link text, hit =C-c C-l=. A mini-buffer will
open up at the bottom of emacs, letting you fix the link (and edit the
text, too, if you'd like).

All fixed? Good, now hit =C-c C-o= with your cursor on the text to
open the link in your default browser. Pretty neat, huh?

** Getting from Todo to To-done

*** Setup a journal file

*** Populate it with todos

*** Viewing them all

** Reminders, Deadlines, and the Weekly Agenda

*** Autoloading

*** Our Blank Agenda

*** Setting a Deadline

*** Repeating Todos

** Additional Resources

We've just scratched the surface of what org-mode can do. You can use
it to give presentations, sync it with your Google Calendar, even
build spreadsheets!

You'll want to bookmark the [[https://orgmode.org/manual/][Org-Mode Manual]], and come back to it often
to find a new feature to try out.
