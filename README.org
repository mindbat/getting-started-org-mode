/Short Tutorial on how to use org-mode for notes, todos, and reminders/

* Welcome to Org-Mode! [[file:org-mode-unicorn.png]]

Org-Mode can be a deep dive, even for experienced emacs users. This
tutorial will give you a quick tour of just a few of its features:
taking notes, tracking todos, and using the agenda to organize your
days and weeks.

There's lots to explore, so let's get started!

** Taking Notes

*** The Basics

Before we do anything else, let's make sure =auto-fill-mode= comes on
automatically when we're editing org files. It's basically the same as
turning on "Soft wrap" when creating a new [[gist.github.com][gist]].

Add this to your =init.el= file (usually in a directory like
=~/.emacs.d=:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'turn-on-auto-fill)
#+end_src

Then quit and restart emacs.

*** Links

You've already seen a few links in this tutorial. Adding a new one is
easy (and very much like adding one in Markdown).

Let's add a new note entry linking to this repo:

#+begin_example
  - Notes about the org-mode tutorial:
      + repo [[https://github.com/mindbat/getting-started-with-org-mode][here]]
      + the text of the tutorial /is/ a tutorial! mindblown.gif
#+end_example

Nice! Note how org-mode swaps out displaying the link /and/ the text for
just the (now-underlined) _text_.

But there's a typo in our link. How do we fix it?

With your cursor over the link text, hit =C-c C-l=. A mini-buffer will
open up at the bottom of emacs, letting you fix the link (and edit the
text, too, if you'd like).

All fixed? Good, now hit =C-c C-o= with your cursor on the text to
open the link in your default browser. Pretty neat, huh?

** Getting from Todo to To-done

*** Setup a journal file

*** Populate it with todos

*** Viewing them all

** Reminders, Deadlines, and the Weekly Agenda

*** Autoloading

*** Our Blank Agenda

*** Setting a Deadline

*** Repeating Todos

** Additional Resources

We've just scratched the surface of what org-mode can do. You can use
it to give presentations, sync it with your Google Calendar, even
build spreadsheets!

You'll want to bookmark the [[https://orgmode.org/manual/][Org-Mode Manual]], and come back to it often
to find a new feature to try out.
