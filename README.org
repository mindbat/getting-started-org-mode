/Short Tutorial on how to use org-mode for notes, todos, and reminders/

* Welcome to Org-Mode! [[file:org-mode-unicorn.png]]

Org-Mode can be a deep dive, even for experienced emacs users. This
tutorial will give you a quick tour of just a few of its features:
taking notes, tracking todos, and using the agenda to organize your
days and weeks.

There's lots to explore, so let's get started!

** Taking Notes

*** Init the el

Before we do anything else, let's make sure =auto-fill-mode= comes on
automatically when we're editing org files. It's basically the same as
turning on "Soft wrap" when creating a new [[gist.github.com][gist]].

Add this to your =init.el= file (usually in a directory like
=~/.emacs.d=:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'turn-on-auto-fill)
#+end_src

Then quit and restart emacs.

*** The Basics

The easiest way to get started using org-mode is for taking notes.

Open a new org buffer: =emacs tutorial.org=

This is going to be a daily journal. A record of things done, things
to do, and things we can yet only dream of.

Let's give the doc a header. A title, a declaration of purpose. Make
it the month and the year, so we know what we're looking at when we
come back:

#+begin_example
  * May 2021
#+end_example

Well done! It's not much, but it's the start of great things.

Let's make some sub-headings under there, for the days of the month:

#+begin_example
  * May 2021
  ** 3 May
  ** 4 May
  ** 5 May
  ** 6 May
  ** 7 May
#+end_example

More interesting, by far. And now we've unlocked the first of
org-mode's many powers: nesting.

Scroll back up to the first line, and hit =<tab>=.

Whoa! Where'd the other headings go?

Hit =<tab>= again. The top-level heading unfolds, revealing the
subheadings again.

org-mode carries this principle -- where sub-items are nested inside
higher-level ones, and can be revealed and hidden at will -- all the
way down, through headings, notes, etc.

Speaking of notes, let's add some:

#+begin_example
  * May 2021
  ** 3 May
  *** grocery-store run
  - need to pick up:
    + eggs
    + oat milk
    + cinnamon
    + loaf of bread (thick slices)
    + sugar
  - don't forget your mask!
  *** weekly council of ricks meeting
  - rick037 is loose again
  - rick048 thinks we should just let him go
    + i disagree
    + also rick048 has a mullet so we should ignore him
  - jerry077 got swapped with jerry099 at the last iteration of jerry's day-care romp,
    neither rick is admitting responsibility
  ** 4 May
  ** 5 May
  ** 6 May
  ** 7 May
#+end_example

Ok! Now we've got a list of groceries to pick up, and some meeting
notes. Play around with the nesting of the various elements, both by
hitting =<tab>= at various points to see what's revealed/hidden, and
changing the indention levels of the text. Notice which things
org-mode cares about, and which it ignores?

Congratulations! You've already mastered the art of taking notes in
org-mode. Well done!

*** Links

You've already seen a few links in this tutorial. Adding a new one is
easy (and very much like adding one in Markdown).

Let's add a new note entry linking to this repo:

#+begin_example
  - Notes about the org-mode tutorial:
      + repo [[https://github.com/mindbat/getting-started-with-org-mode][here]]
      + the text of the tutorial /is/ a tutorial! mindblown.gif
#+end_example

Nice! Note how org-mode swaps out displaying the link /and/ the text for
just the (now-underlined) _text_.

But there's a typo in our link. How do we fix it?

With your cursor over the link text, hit =C-c C-l=. A mini-buffer will
open up at the bottom of emacs, letting you fix the link (and edit the
text, too, if you'd like).

All fixed? Good, now hit =C-c C-o= with your cursor on the text to
open the link in your default browser. Pretty neat, huh?

** Getting from Todo to To-done

*** Todos in the Journal

Any heading can become a TODO. Let's add a reminder to do the laundry:

#+begin_example
  * May 2021
  ** 5 May
  *** TODO wash dirty clothes
#+end_example

Once the chore is done, you can mark it complete by setting your
cursor anywhere on the TODO line, and hitting =C-c C-t=.

You can add lists under todos like anything else, in case you need
notes about the item:

#+begin_example
  * May 2021
  ** 5 May
  *** TODO wash dirty clothes
  - don't forget the laundry hamper in the downstairs closet!
  - but don't wash the new shirts, those are dry-clean only!
#+end_example

These obey the same show/hide rules as everything else. Try it out!

*** I Would Like to See a Full List of Everything I've Left Undone, Please

Okay, fine. It's not enough to scroll through and find your
todos. Sometimes we need to see them all at once.

Before we can do that, though, we'll need to tell emacs (and thus
org-mode) where to find our Todos, so it can add them to the (drumroll
please) /Agenda/.

Add the following code to your emacs =init.el= file:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq org-agenda-files (append (directory-files-recursively "~/getting-started-org-mode" "org$")))
#+end_src

(Note: The above assumes you're adding your tutorial org-files to your copy
of this repo. If that's not the case, you'll need to update the path
there to point to where you /are/ keeping your org files)

Restart emacs. With your =tutorial.org= buffer open again, hit: =M-x
org-agenda=, then press =t=. You should see a list of all your todos,
across all the org files in this directory. Go ahead, try adding a new
org file, putting a todo in it, and then refreshing the agenda buffer
(hint: =C-x b= to switch back to the buffer, then =g= to refresh the list)

** Reminders, Deadlines, and the Weekly Agenda

"That's all fine, Mr Mindbat, but what if I need to set a deadline for
a todo? You know, something to remind me that I absolutely /have/ to
get it done by X date?"

Well, you're in luck! Because adding a deadline, and seeing a list of
upcoming todos, is just as easy!

*** Setting a Deadline

Add a new Todo to your growing list:

#+begin_example
  * May 2021
  ** 6 May
  *** TODO buy tickets for summer vacation
#+end_example

That'll definitely have a deadline, right? We need to buy the tickets
before (long before) we can go on the trip!

So let's add a deadline! With your cursor on the Todo line, hit =C-c
C-d=. You'll see another mini-buffer pop-up, this time with a date
auto-populated (it should be your current date) and a calendar
displayed above. Enter the date you want for the deadline in the
mini-buffer (note the format!), and when you hit enter, you should see
something like this:

#+begin_example
  * May 2021
  ** 6 May
  *** TODO buy tickets for summer vacation
      DEADLINE: <2021-06-05 Sat>
#+end_example

Anytime you want to /edit/ the deadline, you can either do it
directly, or go back to the TODO line and hit =C-c C-d= again to bring
up the calendar + mini-buffer.

Add a few more todos with deadlines, this time picking dates in the
next day or so. Then hit =M-x org-agenda= followed by =a= (not /t/
this time), and voila! A view of all your todos for the coming week!

*** Repeating Todos

** Additional Resources

We've just scratched the surface of what org-mode can do. You can use
it to give presentations, sync it with your Google Calendar, even
build spreadsheets!

You'll want to bookmark the [[https://orgmode.org/manual/][Org-Mode Manual]], and come back to it often
to find a new feature to try out.
